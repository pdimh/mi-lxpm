# MI-LXPM

This project implements the MI-LXPM [1] algorithm.

## Objective

Main objective is to implement the MI-LXPM algorithm suited for solving Mixed Integer Programming problems.

## Instructions

All configuration is available through config.json. I have added configurations which are given in the original paper. You can change as you wish.

1. Install numpy
2. Configure config.json and define what problem is going to be solved. Problems are located inside src/problems folder
3. Run main.py

## Problems

New problems can be added, see [problem1](src/problems/problem1.py) and [problem17](src/problems/problem17.py) for an example.
